#The Data
#We will use a data frame with 777 observations on the following 18 variables.
#Private A factor with levels No and Yes indicating private or public university
#Apps Number of applications received
#Accept Number of applications accepted
#Enroll Number of new students enrolled
#Top10perc Pct. new students from top 10% of H.S. class
#Top25perc Pct. new students from top 25% of H.S. class
#F.Undergrad Number of fulltime undergraduates
#P.Undergrad Number of parttime undergraduates
#Outstate Out-of-state tuition
#Room.Board Room and board costs
#Books Estimated book costs
#Personal Estimated personal spending
#PhD Pct. of faculty with Ph.D.â€™s
#Terminal Pct. of faculty with terminal degree
#S.F.Ratio Student/faculty ratio
#perc.alumni Pct. alumni who donate
#Expend Instructional expenditure per student
